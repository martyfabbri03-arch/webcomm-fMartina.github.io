# Exam Project Web Communications 2025
### Student: Martina Fabbri
This repository contains the website and the pitch for the web communication exam.
The website has been created to raise awareness about the **Sagra de Caplet** and to make attendance easier for everyone by enhancing the historical roots of the sagra and creating forms for reservation and useful contacts, which the sagra previously lacked.
